# Replit.md - Decentralized Mesh Network Chat Application

## Overview

This is a decentralized mesh network chat application built with React, Express.js, and TypeScript. The application enables peer-to-peer messaging through WebRTC connections, Bluetooth discovery, and encrypted communications in a mesh network topology. It features a cyberpunk-inspired UI with real-time messaging, network visualization, and ephemeral stories functionality.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cyberpunk theme and CSS variables
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (schema defined, using Neon serverless)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for signaling
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with WebSocket for real-time features

### Database Schema
The application uses four main tables:
- `users`: Store user profiles with wallet addresses and public keys
- `messages`: Encrypted peer-to-peer messages with mesh routing info
- `meshNodes`: Track network nodes and their connection status
- `stories`: Ephemeral content with expiration timestamps

## Key Components

### Peer-to-Peer Communication
- **WebRTC Manager**: Handles direct peer connections and data channels
- **Bluetooth Integration**: Web Bluetooth API for device discovery
- **Encryption Layer**: RSA-OAEP and AES-GCM for message encryption
- **Mesh Routing**: Multi-hop message delivery through network nodes

### User Interface Components
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time messaging with encryption indicators
- **Network Explorer**: Visual representation of mesh network topology
- **Radar View**: Animated radar display showing nearby nodes
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Tabbed interface for different app sections
- **Right Panel**: Stories feed and network statistics

### Real-time Features
- **WebSocket Signaling**: Coordinates WebRTC connections between peers
- **Live Network Status**: Shows connected peers and signal strength
- **Ephemeral Stories**: Time-limited content sharing
- **Message Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for all communications

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users connect with wallet addresses and generate key pairs
2. **Network Discovery**: Bluetooth and WebRTC discovery of nearby nodes
3. **Mesh Connection**: Establish encrypted connections with discovered peers
4. **Message Routing**: Messages hop through mesh network to reach recipients
5. **Content Sharing**: Stories and messages propagate through the network
6. **Data Persistence**: Critical data stored in PostgreSQL, ephemeral content expires

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database queries and migrations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **@radix-ui/react-***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **ws**: WebSocket server implementation

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production

### Browser APIs
- **Web Bluetooth**: Device discovery and connection
- **WebRTC**: Peer-to-peer communication
- **Web Crypto API**: Client-side encryption and key generation

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with Express backend
- **Hot Reloading**: React Fast Refresh and server restart on changes
- **Database**: Uses DATABASE_URL environment variable for connection
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, ESBuild bundles backend

### Production Deployment
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` - compiles both frontend and backend
- **Start Command**: `npm start` - runs the production server
- **Static Assets**: Frontend builds to `dist/public` directory
- **Server Bundle**: Backend compiles to `dist/index.js`

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- **NODE_ENV**: Controls development vs production behavior
- **Session Configuration**: Uses connect-pg-simple for session storage

The application is designed to work in environments with intermittent connectivity, making it ideal for decentralized communication scenarios where traditional server-client architectures might fail.

## Current Project Status - July 18, 2025

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- **Express Backend Server**: Fully operational REST API with all endpoints responding correctly
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM working properly for user management, network analytics, and data persistence
- **User Registration System**: Device-based authentication with RSA key generation and profile management functioning
- **Network Analytics**: Real-time network monitoring with performance metrics and connection statistics
- **File Transfer Infrastructure**: Backend file transfer system with chunked uploads and progress tracking
- **Modern UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui interface with cyberpunk theme and responsive design
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time messaging interface with encryption indicators and user avatars
- **Profile Management**: User profile system with image upload, username, and bio editing capabilities

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues & Limitations

#### Critical WebSocket Connectivity Problems
- **Frequent Connection Drops**: WebSocket connections consistently disconnect immediately after connecting
- **Authentication Timeouts**: Users experiencing "Authentication timeout, forcing registration step" errors
- **Reconnection Loops**: Automatic reconnection attempts failing with exponential backoff (attempts 1-3)
- **Connection Stability**: WebSocket error events (`{"isTrusted":true}`) occurring on every connection attempt

#### Functional Limitations
- **Real-Time Features Impaired**: Chat messaging, network discovery, and live updates affected by WebSocket issues
- **Mesh Network Not Fully Active**: Advanced mesh connection established but immediately drops due to WebSocket instability
- **P2P Communication Limited**: WebRTC signaling affected by unreliable WebSocket connections
- **User Experience Degraded**: Frequent connection attempts visible in console causing performance impact

#### Technical Debt & Missing Features
- **WebRTC Implementation**: Peer-to-peer connections need WebSocket stability for proper signaling
- **Bluetooth Integration**: Web Bluetooth API integration present but not fully tested
- **Stories Feature**: Ephemeral content system built but limited by real-time connectivity issues
- **File Transfer UI**: Backend infrastructure complete but frontend file transfer interface needs WebSocket reliability

### üîß Immediate Priorities for Resolution

#### 1. WebSocket Connection Stabilization
- Investigate and fix the root cause of immediate disconnections
- Implement proper error handling and connection state management
- Add connection persistence mechanisms and heartbeat functionality
- Debug authentication timeout issues in the WebSocket handshake

#### 2. Real-Time Communication Recovery
