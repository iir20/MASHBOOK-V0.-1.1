- Vite for fast development and optimized builds  
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for modern cyberpunk interface
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- TanStack React Query for server state management
- Framer Motion for smooth animations

BACKEND STACK:
- Node.js + Express.js server with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- WebSocket server for real-time communication
- WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections
- Advanced encryption (RSA-OAEP + AES-GCM)

DATABASE SCHEMA:
- users: User profiles with mesh credentials and security levels
